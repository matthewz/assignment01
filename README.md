Programming Pre-Screen

Discussion 
==========

How you solved the problem: 

1) Two tables in the form of Bash Associative Arrays
2) Exploit the utilities available in UNIX such as: tr, grep, cut
3) Just treat it as a series of simple data processing algorithm, keep it simple 

* The code was developed and tested on Mac OS 10.15.3 using "GNU bash, version 5.0.16(1)-release"

How would it behave based on the different parameters:

1) Uses absolute value to find nearest floor's conference room
2) Time ranges would need to match ranges found in the input data
3) Always finds a room that will hold up to the maximum team size
4) Limitations are it only solves the problem of quickly finding one or more rooms

How to test the program:

Create a set of Unit Tests that call the program 
with extremes and norms of Begin/End times and team sizes
using an expected resulting room number based on the txt file
given as a function of TEAM + TIME = ROOM kind of input data.  

Extra Credit:

Improve the solution to allow for more flexibility in meeting times and proportional
reservation times.
